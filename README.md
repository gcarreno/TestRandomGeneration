The objective of this repository is to have a personal copy of the Random Generation function from Prof. Marsaglia.

The code is taken from Thaddy de Koning's entry on the [Free Pascal Wiki](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Marsaglia%27s_pseudo_random_number_generators).

I'm using an MIT License for the time being. Need to have a talk with Thaddy to sort that out.
